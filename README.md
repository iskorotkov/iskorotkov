### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer specializing in ASP.NET Core (C#) and Go, although I also have experience in Blazor, React, and TypeScript.

I've extensively used Docker and Kubernetes in my coursework where I developed a platform for resilience testing of distributed systems. I also had to implement the Bully algorithm for leader election in distributed systems to test both it and the developed testing platform.

I develop desktop game prototypes (Unreal Engine 4, C++) in my free time.
