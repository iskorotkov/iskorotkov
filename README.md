### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer with vast experience in Go.

I have experience in designing, implementing and deploying microservices using Go, RabbitMQ, Kafka and Kubernetes. I worked on splitting both Go and PHP monoliths into independent services, implemented event-driven architecture.

I worked with REST, gRPC and GraphQL APIs, SSH, TELNET and SNMP. I used Kafka, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch and Redis.

Though backend development is my main focus, I also created frontend apps with React.js & TypeScript/JavaScript and implemented data transformation pipelines (ETL).

See [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iskorotkov/).

Interesting projects I've made:

- VSCode extensions for CRUD operations on DigitalOcean droplets that allows connecting to droplets via SSH ([client](https://github.com/iskorotkov/remote-vm), [server](https://github.com/iskorotkov/remote-vm-server))
- leader election algorithm implementation ([repo](https://github.com/iskorotkov/bully-election))
- package manager for downloading and unpacking releases directly from GitHub ([repo](https://github.com/iskorotkov/package-manager-cli))
- dashboard with stock and crypto prices that can be deployed to K8S ([org](https://github.com/finance-dashboard))
