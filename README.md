# Ivan Korotkov

**Senior Go Developer** building high-throughput systems at [Aviasales](https://www.aviasales.com) — processing millions of flight prices daily.

I optimize what's slow, fix what's broken, and occasionally mass-migrate what's legacy.

### What I do
- Architect storage systems handling 50M+ daily requests at sub-10ms latency
- Migrate legacy stacks (PHP, Ruby, Elixir) to Go with 80-90% cost reduction
- Hunt memory leaks and data races in concurrent Go code
- Write about Go internals on [Habr](https://habr.com/en/users/iskorotkov/) (20k+ readers)

### Tech
`Go` `Rust` `TypeScript` `PostgreSQL` `Redis` `Kafka` `Kubernetes` `gRPC` `GraphQL`
