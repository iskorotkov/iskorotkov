### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer with more than a year of experience in Go. I have experience in designing new microservices and splitting monolith app into several independent services as well as creating perfect UX with React & TypeScript/JavaScript.

I've also worked on Data Enginering and DevOps tasks at my company where we needed to collect and analyze a lot of data about client activity and the performance of our services. I've worked on loading data into Elasticsearch and visualizing it with Kibana dashboards for managers and our clients.

See [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iskorotkov/).

Interesting projects I've made:

- VSCode extensions for CRUD operations on DigitalOcean droplets that allows connecting to droplets via SSH ([client](https://github.com/iskorotkov/remote-vm), [server](https://github.com/iskorotkov/remote-vm-server))
- leader election algorithm implementation ([repo](https://github.com/iskorotkov/bully-election))
- package manager for downloading and unpacking releases directly from GitHub ([repo](https://github.com/iskorotkov/package-manager-cli))
- dashboard with stock and crypto prices that can be deployed to K8S ([org](https://github.com/finance-dashboard))
