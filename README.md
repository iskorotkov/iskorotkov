### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer with experience in Go.

I've also worked on Data Enginering and DevOps tasks at my company where we needed to collect and analyze a lot of data about client activity and the performance of our services. I've worked on loading data into Elasticsearch and visualizing it with Kibana dashboards for managers and our clients.
